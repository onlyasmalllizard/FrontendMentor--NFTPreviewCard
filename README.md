# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component

This is my second Frontend Mentor challenge. I've been making two versions of each one: the first time with vanilla CSS, the second with TailwindCSS.

## Version 1

While I was working, I noticed that my CSS file was becoming confusing. I was having a hard time finding things, even on the same day I wrote them.

I refactored the file using a table of contents and grouping rules by category. This makes the file longer overall, but it is easier to understand and maintain.

## Things I am morally obligated to say

1. Frontend Mentor needs to review all its designs for text contrast issues.
2. Cryptocurrency is a scam.
3. NFTs are even more of a scam than crypto.
